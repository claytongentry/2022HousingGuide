          <p>1838 Chicago is located a stone's throw from the Arch, and the Intercampus shuttle stop sits right outside the dorm's front door. In addition to new community spaces on the first floor, the facility (newly renovated in 2016) includes a large recreation room providing students with a workout spot that's closer than Henry Crown Sports Pavillion or Blom.

          <p>WHAT RESIDENTS SAY
            “I'd say it's the best South Campus dorm. It has the best amenities like Shepard and Allison but since it's a little smaller it's more social than either one (however my experience is based on the fact that it's all freshman. It might change next year). The best part is probably having the gym in the building and having access to Shepard.”

          <p>
          “The dorm has really nice facilities and a lot of great social spaces. Despite that, I feel like 1838's size lends itself to smaller friendship groups instead of a larger dorm community. South campus is great because it makes access to Evanston really convenient, and puts Medill and Comm kids right next to their classes. That being said, the walk up Sheridan does make you feel like you're missing out on most of the social happenings on campus.”
