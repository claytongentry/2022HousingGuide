Ten dorms on campus offer all-gender housing, which is usually a cluster of all-gender designated rooms on a certain wing or floor. Our information lists the all-gender housing options according to Residential Services. In many dorms, students will only be placed in an all-gender wing or suite if they opt-in, so students who do not opt-in will not be assigned to an all-gender wing or suite. For transparency's sake, we want to acknowledge that not all students have had positive experiences with all-gender housing.

              <td id="campus">Generally, South Campus is known for humanities and North Campus is known for STEM, mostly because of proximity to classes. North Campus also has more of a party reputation for its proximity to fraternity quad, but South Campus has more of an artsy vibe and is a shorter walk to downtown Evanston, grocery stores and restaurants. If you want to live in a suite, look to the several dorms on North Campus, but beware the walk South to downtown and classes in the winter. We divided the dorms into North and South Campus based on Foster St.
