    description: "Don't make the same mistake I did: Allison does NOT have ten floors, only four. Room 1005 is on the first floor. Known for having the best south dining hall and gender-open housing on the first floor. Allison's hallways look like an orange color that belongs in American Horror Story. Does induce hallucinations. So many doors on the stairs for no reason. The rooms are super nice, but the bathroom showers always leak and the bathrooms are super gross. No one calls it Hotel Allison, but everyone says it's called that. Would recommend it to a friend â€” unless you have asthma or respiratory issues, because the entire dorm is carpet except for the bathrooms. ",

    "I have met most people at Allison outside of Allison. Lots of people come to hang out in the first floor lounge. Allison is definitely less social than other dorms. I would maybe prefer to live North Campus like in Elder just so I could get to classes at Tech faster."

    "It's super quiet. You don't really get to know the people in Allison. But the dorms are super nice, and the bathrooms are cool, and the dining hall is downstairs, so the amenities make up for the lack of social life. Also love having laundry on the same floor. But the dorm is quiet and probably isn't the place to make a lot of friends. I'm not sure if I would change because the dorm is really nice, but I would like to live somewhere more social."

    "I like how it's right on top of a dining hall and close to all my classes on South Campus. Even if my classes are at Bienen or Swift Hall, they are still very walkable from Allison. I wish my room could be bigger and closer to the laundry room and the elevator."

It is also nice that we have basic amenities like an elevator and air conditioning. One complaint I have is that laundry can be very frustrating, and the walls are a bit thin, but that's no problem if you invest in some good earplugs for sleepy time. I would not want to live anywhere else. I will admit that I have fallen in love with Ayers despite its minor flaws."

    "We have the largest doubles on campus, which allows for spacious living, and even the bathrooms are very big and clean. One drawback is that it's pretty far from some classes because it's at the southwest corner of campus, especially in winter quarter. If you engage with the community it's really nice, and it's across from Willard, where you can be part of the southwest area community."

I love the fancy plaster ceilings, the plentitude of sofas in the lounges, the spacious rooms, the clean bathrooms and all the free-food events. I don't like the fact that the first floor washer and dryer have been broken for several quarters now and the fact that people don't know how to keep the kitchen looking decent."

    "I would say the vibe of CRC is quirky core because there are a lot of little random things, like the bright red bathroom stalls and the movie theater off the main lounge that make it super unique. The small rooms are definitely not it, but there are a lot of welcome surprises within CRC that I didn't know when I was choosing housing, and they make it worth it!"

Whether it's garbage trucks, food delivery trucks or construction, it's all uncalled for and highly inconsiderate. This is a huge issue, making it difficult to get enough/proper sleep. Wouldn't live here again."

The laundry is very far, and I can hear both the cars on the road and the hand dryers in the bathroom from my room, so it can be pretty loud at times. Overall, the rooms and bathrooms are pretty decent though, and the location is close to SPAC and Tech, so I would still choose to live here."

I wouldn't mind living there again next year. I would highly recommend it over Lincoln for first years because you'll make more friends in Elder, but for second years I'd recommend Lincoln. If I had known this I would've ranked Elder first instead of second last year, but it's always been ranked high for me."

    "The vibe depends on which floor you're on. Some floors are very outgoing, and they get to know each other a lot, and they'll be loud at night, but in a good way. Some floors are very keep to yourself, quiet, everybody does their own thing. There's something about the roommate experience that you miss out on, for sure, but I think there are a lot of other aspects that make up for it, especially the fact that the whole building is singles. You get to know people, nobody's like hiding in their room, away from everyone else. You have the food and the convenience store and the laundry, which is very convenient. My least favorite part about living here would be that the walls are very thin. It's in the perfect spot on campus, because it's South Campus, which is by most of the classes, but it's the northernmost part of South Campus, so it's still not far from any of the north buildings. If you have a hard time making friends, though, I might not recommend it."

I think if you're a relatively social person in the first place, living in Plex isn't that bad of a decision for making friends, because you meet people in all sorts of places, and it's nice to be able to come back to your own room, and not have a roommate. The walls are super thin, which isn't great, and the bathrooms aren't super nice, but they do the job."

    "It's very chill, it's very friendly. I would say most of the friends I have come from Plex. It's the Plex ecosystem. I think there's a stigma because of Plex being kind of an isolation dorm because of Covid and because it's all singles, but I actually found it very easy to make friends because no one had that instant roommate connection, so everyone was always out in the hallways."

    "Honestly, I was a bit hesitant when I first moved in because it's just a dorm full of singles, and everyone called it the prison dorm or the quarantine dorms, but after moving in I realized that my floor has a cute little community. My least favorite thing is how thin the walls are, because I'm kind of loud, and I feel bad especially because of my loud friends. I love that the dining hall and package center are right downstairs. It's kind of in the middle of campus, so it's not too far from either end, and it's closer to downtown when I have to do things there. My favorite thing is having a single dorm that's pretty cute. We have brick walls and windows that don't have bars on them, which is pretty cool."

    "The vibe is cottagecore or cozy and close-knit, friendly. It's an older building, and you can tell, but it also offers a lot of charm in the architecture and stuff! The laundry is in the basement, and laundry maintenance is not great, and the carpeting should be replaced, but there are so many spaces to be social and have guests. There's a general con of community living in terms of kitchens and bathrooms, but it's only slightly better in suite-style living. A smaller dorm is less daunting because it's not like total strangers in the bathroom. If I were to select dorms again maybe I would want something closer to my classes, but even then I would be a non-res at Hobart because the community is so nice and welcoming."

I like the non-carpeted floors, the abundance of counter space in the bathrooms and the location!

I like the cleanliness and how modern the bathrooms are. I like that there is a nice study room and lounge. I don't have any problem with the dorm itself, just wish it was a tad more social.

Amazing that there is laundry on each floor too. Shepard Hall definitely has a more relaxed and calm vibe than dorms on North Campus. Pretty good location since you're next to downtown Evanston and Allison dining hall. Most of the people are super nice and welcoming. It is much more social than I had thought, which was a plus. Although it is far from Tech and I am a STEM major, it is a great way to get to know downtown Evanston your first year."

    "Building-wise, Shepard is beautiful: everything is fairly clean and new, and it's hard to feel disappointed by its ambience. It's a bit worse community-wise, though, since the residents generally stick to themselves / their friend groups and bonding events are basically nonexistent. It's hard to reach out and become close with other Shepard residents - especially later in the school year. The only candidate I would rank above Shepard would be Willard, as it shares both benefits of a nice ambience + a closer community."

    "Neat and clean, modern, chill but maybe a little antisocial across floors. The facilities are great, and the entire dorm looks modern and renovated! I think having nice bathrooms really makes a difference for the whole "living on campus" experience. The rooms aren't huge, but it's more than enough space (it looks much smaller on the website than it does in person). If I had to nitpick, having microwaves on each floor would be really nice, as would an elevator when you're lugging suitcases up to the fourth floor."

    "Everything is pretty clean, but it doesn't feel super social. People don't really hang out in the common areas in a casual way, but the people are nice. I like the location of Shepard and the bathrooms for sure. The basement is also super nice to have because there are a lot of nice facilities and study spaces down there. I don't like that it's a little antisocial and there isn't an elevator there, but honestly you get used to having to go up the stairs - coming from someone who lived on the fourth floor. It's definitely a great place to live - especially if South Campus is your vibe."

Being a res college, the weekly events are so fun and great for getting to know people. The only thing I dislike is the laundry machines because they don't work half the time.

    "636 has charm! The vibes are good, I like the people here, and it's a super pretty building from the outside. Our lounges are quite nice too. The location is nice (right between Plex and Allison, so we've got our choice of dining hall), and it's really not a far walk from Tech, where the majority of my classes have been. However, THIS DORM WAS NOT READY TO BE LIVED IN! The so-called renovations were rushed. Some highlights are the bathroom flooding three times from the same place, the radiators from HELL that thunk extremely loudly at all hours of the night and the front door to the building malfunctioning twice. If not for those problems, 636 would be a decent dorm."

    "It's very small, quiet and cozy. For people seeking a vibrant social scene, 636 probably isn't the best option - but if you'd like a more solitary dorm experience, this is the way to go. I really like the common spaces in the dorm. The atmosphere is pretty homey, and it's nice to have a living room with a TV. Major downsides to this dorm are that it doesn't have AC and things are frequently breaking/flooding/otherwise in disrepair."

    "It's small and usually quiet. Likes: quiet, never have to wait to pee or shower. Dislikes: no AC, no ventilation, have to go to the basement for the water fountain and laundry, showers are SO SMALL, our bathroom ceiling leaks a ton."

    "The view of the sorority quad from our window is beautiful, and it's pretty quiet. If there's ever a problem, maintenance is very kind. 636 is not a party dorm. I have not been kept up by my neighbors ever. It's one of the cheapest dorms to live in, which is nice. The rooms are decently large. And our washers/dryers are brand new! However - the dorm is renovated in the most general sense. They stuck in some ugly modern furniture and swept a bit, and that was it. Surprisingly, I have enjoyed my time at 636 Emerson. It's been a blast."

    "Pretty chill but not very tight because of how big it is. The single rooms are really small. The amenities are nice (laundry on every floor). It is very far north which gets annoying when you need to go to South Campus. Lincoln is a good place to live!"
    <br>- Class of 2023
    <br><br>
    "It's a good mix of social and isolated. Most people hang out in lounges or have people over, as the suite style rooms enable hosting. Being at the north end of campus can sometimes get tiring, especially during a quarter where all of your classes are south. I really enjoy having an elevator, my own bathroom and a kitchen on every floor. It's a super bright and clean dorm, which makes it feel homier."
    <br>- Class of 2025
    <br><br>
    "Love love love the amenities that come with Lincoln. The rooms are so nice, and the bathroom area is so clean and nice and private! The nice kitchens and lounges on each floor are also great for studying or watching a movie with friends! The one thing about Lincoln is that the suite style is not conducive for making friends. It's hard to meet people and befriend people on your floor. Lots of people I know in other dorms made most of their friends at first from where they lived, but that isn't the case in Lincoln. Amenities > everything, you'll make your friends elsewhere anyway."

    <br><br>
    "It's chill, open, pretty quiet. I like the space, view, not having to leave the room to go to the bathroom/shower, having suitemates, lounges, easy access to kitchens and laundry. There have been some problems with the fire alarm, and it's the northernmost dorm (so kinda far from stuff)."
